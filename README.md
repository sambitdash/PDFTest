# PDFTest

We have been developing PDF Reader APIs in Julia ([PDFIO](https://github.com/sambitdash/PDFIO.jl)) for some time now. As part of the project, We need to test the APIs with various test files. The PDF files used for testing may have license restrictions different from the *MIT License*, the license used for the PDFIO APIs. The PDF file repository developed here is merely for testing the PDFIO APIs. The following 
limitations apply to the usage of these PDF files.
